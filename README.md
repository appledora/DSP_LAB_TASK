## Codes for DSP426 
**Tasks:**
 1. Generate and plot the elementary signals in DSP (Impulse, unit impulse, ramp,and exponential signals)
 2. Compute the linear convolution of two signals
 3. Compute the cross-correlation sequence of two signals x(n) and h(n)
 4. Determine the autocorrelation sequence of the signal x(n)
 5. Compute Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a signal using DFT equation
 6. Compute inverse DFT of the signal obtained in (5). Cross check your results with Matlab/ Python library functions
 7. By means of the DFT and IDFT, determine the response of the FIR filter with impulse response h(n) to the input sequence x(n)
 8. Compute the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using divide and conquer approach (e.g N=2 x N/2)


Small code snippets are written to emulate various DSP formulas from scratch. For validation, the outputs are compared with `Numpy` library functions. Plots are generated for most of the functions, by using `matplotlib`. All the functions also contain their theoretical definitions and backgrounds.
